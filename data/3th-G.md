--In the loop in SafEth's [stake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L87) function, the weight of the current derivative is checked to determine whether the subsequent calculation is necessary. However, as seen in the above-linked line of code, this check comes after storing the current derivative as [`derivative`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L86). This value is never used if the weight of the derivative is `0`--therefore, the weight check should be moved up a line to save the gas associated with the unnecessary data storage.
