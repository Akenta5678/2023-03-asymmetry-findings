Aside from the messages returned from `require` statements, there is no error handling present in the critically important `stake` and `unstake` flows, nor are any checks in place to validate the output of any of the logic within these flows. Especially considering the [long chunks of logic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L156) in derivatives like `Reth.sol`, there are many points at which it could fail. Although this may not lead to a massive loss of funds, repeated failed attempts could lead to users wasting gas. It also limits the composability of the protocol.

This is marked as non-critical because I was not able to come up with a way to exploit this specifically, but given the amount of logic in each derivative's `deposit` and `withdraw` functions, it's very possible there could be higher severity side effects from silent failures within any of these functions.
