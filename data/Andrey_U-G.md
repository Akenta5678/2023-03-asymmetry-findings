# Initialization of zero variables.
You don't need to initialize zero variables as it is default value of them
example: `uint i = 0` -> `uint i`
# Comparing bool values in if and require statements.
Instead of comparing bool values using `==` operator you can use `!` not operator
example: `pauseUnstaking == false` -> `!pauseUnstaking`
# Changing incrementing operator in `for`
You can change `i++` to `++i`, it will not affect on `i` variable but will save a little gas.
