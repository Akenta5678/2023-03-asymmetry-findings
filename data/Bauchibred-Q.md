#  L-01 Missing events for critical changes

## Impact

This would lead to lack of track keeping of the status of the system off-chain 

## Proof of Concept

[WsEth.setMaxSlippage()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L48-L50)

[SfrxEth.setMaxSlippage()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/SfrxEth.sol#L51-L53)

[SafEth.setMaxSlippage()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L202-L208)

[Reth.setMaxSlippage()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L58-L60)

All four contracts have  the  `setMaxSlippage()` function but an event is only emitted when a call is made on SafEth.sol, as i understand this is due to the fact that  SafEth.sol is the main contract for staking and unstaking nonetheless, Iâ€™d recommend an event is emitted in all four contracts check this and if that's not the case, include it in the natspec comments



## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider emitting events when these addresses/values are updated. This will be more transparent and it will make it easier to keep track of the status of the system.
