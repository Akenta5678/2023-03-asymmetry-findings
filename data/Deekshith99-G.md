## [G-1]Usage of uints or ints  smaller than 32 bytes incurs overhead
When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes or 256 bits , your contract's gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size
