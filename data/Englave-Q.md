L01. Ether receive without sender restriction
The current contract implementation presents a potential risk for users due to its unrestricted nature, allowing anyone to send Ether to the contracts. It will result in the permanent loss of funds without providing any benefits to the affected users.
To mitigate this risk and enhance the security of the contract implementation, it is recommended to incorporate the receive function along with a `msg.sender` check. This approach will allow only designated contracts to send native tokens, effectively protecting users from unintended loss of funds.

L02. Risks Associated with Floating Pragma
The use of floating pragma in Solidity contracts has been identified as a potential source of security risks and unintended behavior. Floating pragma refers to the practice of using non-specific or non-fixed version numbers in the pragma statement, which may cause the contract to compile with different compiler versions, each with its own set of features and potential vulnerabilities.

Risks:
1. Security Vulnerabilities: Compiling with different compiler versions may inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities that were not present in the intended version. This can leave the contract susceptible to attacks and exploitation.
2. Unintended Behavior: Different compiler versions can lead to varying interpretations of the contract code, resulting in unintended behavior and potential loss of funds or data.
3. Incompatibilities: As new versions of the Solidity compiler are released, backward compatibility is not always guaranteed. Using a floating pragma can cause compilation errors or unexpected behavior due to deprecated features or breaking changes.
4. Difficulty in Auditing: The use of floating pragma makes it challenging to ascertain which compiler version was used during the contract's deployment, hindering the auditing process and reducing overall confidence in the contract's security.

Recommended Solution:
To minimize the risks associated with a floating pragma, it is advised to specify a fixed compiler version in the pragma statement. By doing so, developers can ensure that their contracts are compiled using a stable and secure version of the Solidity compiler.
