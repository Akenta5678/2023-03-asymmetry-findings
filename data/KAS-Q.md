As per my assessments there are multiple lines of code need to be update:
# 1
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol #L73-L81
One check is required whether the msg.value sent with the deposit function is greater than zero. This means that the contract could potentially receive transactions with zero ether, which would result in wasted gas fees for the sender and would not add any value to the contract.
A check can be added at the beginning of the deposit function to ensure that msg.value is greater than zero. This can be done with the following code: 
                      require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero");

# 2
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L86
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/SfrxEth.sol#L111
In ethperderivative function in both files there is a argument with the name of "_amount" which is not used in the function so It is recommended to remove this argument. It can be risky if attacker manipulate the code and it still pass the  parameter count testing.

# 3
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L120
The poolCanDeposit function only checks if the rETH deposit pool has enough room for a given deposit amount. It does not perform any checks to verify that the rETH deposit pool is a valid and trusted contract.This could potentially lead to security risks if the rETH deposit pool is not a legitimate contract or if it has been compromised by a malicious actor. If the pool is not legitimate or has been compromised, an attacker could potentially manipulate the deposit pool to steal funds or perform other malicious activities.
