[G-1] Donâ€™t compare boolean expressions to boolean literals
====================
`if (<x> == true) => if (<x>), if (<x> == false) => if (!<x>).`

```solidity
File: contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol
64:         require(pauseStaking == false, "staking is paused");
```

```solidity
File: contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol
109:         require(pauseUnstaking == false, "unstaking is paused");
```

[G-2] `++i/i++` should be `unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for` loops

[G-3] Multiple accesses of a mapping should use a local variable cache
