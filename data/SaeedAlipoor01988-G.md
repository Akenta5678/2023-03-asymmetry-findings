## Make for loop unchecked

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are.

## Impact
The risk of for loops getting overflowed is extremely low. Because it always increments by 1 and is limited to the arrays length. Even if the arrays are extremely long, it will take a massive amount of time and gas to let the for loop overflow.
