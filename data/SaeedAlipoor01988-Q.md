## Use Ownable2StepUpgradeable contract

## Impact
transferOwnership function is used to change Ownership from OwnableUpgradeable.sol. There is another Openzeppelin Ownable contract (Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol) has transferOwnership function , use it is more secure due to 2-stage ownership transfer.

## Unsafe ERC20 Operation(s)

## Impact
ERC20 operations can be unsafe due to different implementations and vulnerabilities in the standard. It is therefore recommended to always either use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library or at least to wrap each operation in a require statement.
To circumvent ERC20's approve functions race-condition vulnerability use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library's safe{Increase|Decrease}Allowance functions.
