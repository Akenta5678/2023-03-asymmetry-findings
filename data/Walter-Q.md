1)Should emit event "initialized"

2)Require(_derivativeIndex<DerativeCount,"Out of Bound"),that would check the "_derivativeIndex" input param inside "adjustWeight"

3)SetMinAmount should check that the input is less than the current value of "maxAmount" making a space between them to stake,so something like this : require(_minAmount<maxAmount,"make it less than maxAmount"); and reverse thing in the "setMaxAmount" that will need to be greater than minAmount so:
require(_maxAmount>minAmount,"make it bigger than minAmount");

4)If someone will send ether to the contract(SafEth) that amount of ether will gone forever and it'll be unrecoverable,even by the owners of the contracts,in fact the weight adjust depends on the different between everyEtherinThePlatform - balanceOfSafEth,so,imagine that the contract has 100 ETH in derivates:
user1 sends 1 eth to SafEth contract
contract's owners see the txn and want to calibrate the weight,to split that eth between derivates
contract's owners call "rebalanceToWeights",but only the current circulating Ether(100ETH) will be weighted between derivates,missing the current balannce(1 ETH) of the contract,remaining within the contract forever.

possible mitigation steps: put a withdrawBalance function for the owners
