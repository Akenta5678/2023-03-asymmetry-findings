1.
Avoid loops whenever possible, especially nested loops. Instead, use data structures that allow for constant-time lookup or caching. For example, in the `stake()` function, you could cache the `ethPerDerivative` value for each derivative to avoid the nested loop that calculates it.

2. Use `if` statements instead of `require` statements for input validation. `require` statements are more expensive than `if` statements because they revert the transaction and refund the remaining gas. For example, in the `stake()` function, you could replace `require(pauseStaking == false, "staking is paused");` with if `(pauseStaking) revert("staking is paused")`.

3. Use `transfer()` instead of `call()` when sending ether to other contracts. `transfer()` is safer and cheaper than `call()`. For example, in the `stake()` function, you could replace `derivative.deposit{value: ethAmount}()`; with `derivative.deposit{value: ethAmount}().transfer(ethAmount)`. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L91

4. Repeated code in events: The events `ChangeMinAmount()` and `ChangeMaxAmount()` both emit the same `uint256` value, which is the new `minAmount` or `maxAmount`. Instead of emitting the value in both events, you could create a single event, such as `ChangeAmount(uint256 amount, string message)`, where `message` is a string indicating whether it is the minimum or maximum amount being changed.

5. Use of continue: The continue statement in the `stake()` and `unstake()` function can be removed by using a more efficient way of iterating over the derivatives array, such as a mapping or an array of indexes.

6. Use of payable functions: The `stake() and `unstake()` functions are marked as `payable`, which means they can receive Ether along with the function call. However, in the current implementation, the Ether received is immediately processed, so it may not be necessary to mark these functions as `payable`. You could consider removing the `payable` keyword if the Ether received is not needed immediately.

7. In the `rethAddress()` function, you could store the `RocketStorageInterface` instance as a contract-level variable instead of creating a new instance each time the function is called. This would save gas because it would reduce the number of calls to the `getAddress()` function.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L68

8. In the `swapExactInputSingleHop()` function, you could add a check to see if the `_minOut` parameter is greater than zero. If it is not, you could skip the call to the Uniswap router, saving gas.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L83-L102

9. In the withdraw() function, you could remove the sent variable and use the require() statement to check if the transfer was successful. This would save gas because it would reduce the number of variables.

10. In the `poolCanDeposit()` function, you could store the `rocketDepositPool` and `rocketProtocolSettings`` instances as contract-level variables instead of creating new instances each time the function is called. This would save gas because it would reduce the number of calls to the getAddress() function.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L120-L150

11. The `poolCanDeposit` function could be made public if it is intended to be called by other contracts. Otherwise, it could be made internal to save gas costs for not creating a new public function entry in the contract ABI.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L120

12. The `swapExactInputSingleHop` function could use `IERC20(_tokenIn).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amountIn)` instead of `IERC20(_tokenIn).approve(UNISWAP_ROUTER, _amountIn)` to save gas costs for approving the token transfer.
