Setting Weight for Index Greater than DerivativeCount

Impact
The adjustWeight function allows the contract owner to set the weight of a derivative at a particular index. However, it does not check if the provided _derivativeIndex is within the range of valid indices, i.e., 0 <= _derivativeIndex < derivativeCount.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
To fix this issue, the adjustWeight function should verify that the provided _derivativeIndex is within the range of valid indices before setting the weight for that index. The code can be updated to include a require statement that checks if _derivativeIndex is less than derivativeCount.
